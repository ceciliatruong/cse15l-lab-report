# Week 1 Lab Report
## Installing VSCode
1. To install VSCode, visit this [download link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). It should send you to this page below, and you should download whichever version that is compatible with your device. I'm currently working on a Windows system, so this tutorial will be catered toward that!

2. After installing the file to your computer, launch the file and it should proceed to setup VSCode on your device. I already have VSCode installed onto my laptop prior to this, so I cannot assist with this part. As for a reference, this is what my program looks like when I launch it.

## Remotely Connecting
1. In order to make sure you can access your course-specific account, you need to install the OpenSSH client onto your device if you have a Windows.
    * First, open up your Settings on Windows and navigate to the Apps section.
    * Then, go to the Optional features section and search up "OpenSSH Client" into the search bar to check if you have it installed. 
    * If it doesn't show up, click on the "View Features" button next to "Add an optional feature", search up "OpenSSH Client", and install. This is done correctly if "OpenSSH Client" shows up under the installed features portion.
